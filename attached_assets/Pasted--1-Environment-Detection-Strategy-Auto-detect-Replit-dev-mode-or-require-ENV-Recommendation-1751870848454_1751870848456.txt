✅ 1. Environment Detection Strategy
❓ Auto-detect Replit dev mode or require ENV?

✔️ Recommendation: Use hybrid approach
Use os.getenv("REPL_ID") or similar to auto-detect Replit in backend

Still allow override with ENV variable in .env for flexibility

In backend:
python
Copy
Edit
IS_PRODUCTION = os.getenv("ENV") == "production" or not os.getenv("REPL_ID")
In frontend:
js
Copy
Edit
const isDev = window.location.hostname.includes("localhost") || window.location.hostname.includes(".replit.dev");
🔒 This helps prevent accidental secure=True on HTTP while still being configurable for future deployment on Vercel, etc.

✅ 2. Cookie Utility Integration
❓ Should set_auth_cookies() handle environment detection internally?

✔️ Recommendation: Yes — environment logic should be internal
Centralize the secure, samesite, httponly flags inside the cookie utility. Keep the calling code clean.

python
Copy
Edit
def set_auth_cookies(response, access_token, refresh_token):
    secure = IS_PRODUCTION
    response.set_cookie("smriti_access_token", access_token, httponly=True, secure=secure, samesite="Lax")
    response.set_cookie("smriti_refresh_token", refresh_token, httponly=True, secure=secure, samesite="Lax")
✅ DRY principle, avoids inconsistencies, and makes future updates trivial.

✅ 3. Error Response Testing Priority
❓ Should we simulate token expiry before full implementation?

✔️ Recommendation: Yes — confirm behavior first
Manually simulate or expire token and hit POST /api/v1/sessions/. Validate:

Does it return 401?

Does it include any WWW-Authenticate or error message?

🔎 Once confirmed, implement secureFetch() with confidence. This reduces guesswork.

If needed, create a dummy endpoint with:

python
Copy
Edit
@app.get("/api/test-token-expired")
async def test_token_expired():
    raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Simulated token expiry")
✅ 4. Implementation Rollout Strategy
❓ Start with journal save or replace all fetch calls at once?

✔️ Recommendation: Start with journal save
It’s the most critical and user-facing flow. Validate:

Token refresh works

Retry logic succeeds

No duplicate requests

No user confusion during silent refresh

Once stable, move on to other areas like /reflections/, /entries/, /settings/.

✅ 5. Refresh Token Validity Handling
❓ What if both tokens are invalid?

✔️ Recommendation: Redirect to login with flash message
In secureFetch():

js
Copy
Edit
if (!refreshRes.ok) {
  alert("Session expired. Please log in again.");
  window.location.href = "/login";
  return;
}
Later, upgrade this to flash messages if your pages already use that pattern.

⚠️ This is critical to avoid infinite loops or silent failures.

✅ 6. Frontend Integration Scope
❓ Gradual migration or immediate full switch?

✔️ Recommendation: Gradual migration, starting with journal.html
Start with:

saveJournalEntry() in journal.html

Wrap only POST /api/v1/sessions/ with secureFetch

Then expand:

entries.html: GET /sessions/user

reflections.html: personalized reflections

settings.html: profile updates

Eventually, replace all fetch() that require authentication.
