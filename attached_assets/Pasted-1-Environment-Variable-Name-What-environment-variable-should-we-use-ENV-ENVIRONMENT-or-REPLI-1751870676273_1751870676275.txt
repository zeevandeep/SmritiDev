1. ✅ Environment Variable Name
❓ What environment variable should we use? ENV, ENVIRONMENT, or REPLIT_ENV?

Recommendation: Use ENV — it's concise and commonly supported.

But before finalizing, check your current setup:

bash
Copy
Edit
print(os.environ)  # Temporarily in startup logs or a test endpoint
If nothing is set, define it in .env like:

env
Copy
Edit
ENV=production
And read it in Python:

python
Copy
Edit
IS_PRODUCTION = os.getenv("ENV") == "production"
✅ Keep it consistent across cookie logic and other env-sensitive toggles.

2. 🔍 Error Response Structure
❓ Should we check response.status === 401 or also look for error messages?

Answer: Check only response.status === 401.

JWT expiry or invalid tokens always return 401 Unauthorized

Avoid relying on message strings — they're implementation-specific and fragile

✅ Add this log in frontend before retry:
js
Copy
Edit
if (response.status === 401) {
  console.warn("Access token expired or invalid – attempting refresh.");
}
And test with:

Expired token

Missing token

Malformed token

You’ll almost always get 401.

3. 🔍 Cookie Settings Consistency
❓ Should we update all cookie-setting locations to use IS_PRODUCTION?

Answer: Yes – all cookie writes should follow the same rule for secure, httponly, and samesite.

Update in:

Location	Cookie Type
/login	Access + Refresh
/auth/google/callback	Access + Refresh
/auth/refresh	New Access Token
/logout	Clear both cookies

🔁 Centralize in a utility like set_auth_cookies(response, access_token, refresh_token) to avoid duplication.

4. 🔍 Frontend Error Handling Integration
❓ Use alert() or flash-style UI for errors in secureFetch()?

Answer: Match existing pattern — if your app uses alert() now, keep that for consistency until you're ready for a better UI.

In secureFetch:

js
Copy
Edit
if (!response.ok) {
  alert("Session expired or unauthorized. Please log in again.");
}
Later, upgrade to flash/toast-style messaging. You could even expose an optional callback:

js
Copy
Edit
secureFetch(url, options, onAuthFail = () => alert(...));
5. 🔄 Token Refresh Race Conditions
❓ What if multiple API calls fail and all try to refresh?

Answer: Yes, this is a real risk. You need refresh queuing (a refresh lock).

✅ Add this in JS:
js
Copy
Edit
let isRefreshing = false;
let refreshPromise = null;

async function secureFetch(url, options = {}) {
  let response = await fetch(url, { ...options, credentials: 'include' });

  if (response.status === 401) {
    if (!isRefreshing) {
      isRefreshing = true;
      refreshPromise = fetch('/api/v1/auth/refresh', {
        method: 'POST',
        credentials: 'include',
      }).finally(() => {
        isRefreshing = false;
      });
    }

    const refreshRes = await refreshPromise;
    if (!refreshRes.ok) {
      alert("Session expired. Please log in again.");
      window.location.href = "/login";
      return;
    }

    // Retry original request
    response = await fetch(url, { ...options, credentials: 'include' });
  }

  return response;
}
✅ This avoids parallel refresh attempts and maintains correct retry behavior.

6. 🎨 User Experience During Refresh
❓ Should there be a loading indicator?

Answer: Keep refresh silent for now — unless the delay is noticeable.
