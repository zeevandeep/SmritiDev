Correct — the root issue is structural, not stylistic. All your positioning tweaks were fighting a broken hierarchy. Let me now give you a blunt architectural fix.

🔍 Root Problem Recap (Confirmed):
	•	You’re trying to make .page-header sticky or fixed within a scrollable area that’s itself inside a position: fixed container (main-content)
	•	Sticky fails because the header’s parent isn’t scrollable — it’s a fixed or flex container
	•	Bootstrap adds interference via fixed-top, .container, and internal paddings/margins
	•	Your scroll container and your header are siblings — but they’re being rendered in a way where the scroll context is above the sticky header

🔨 What Needs to Change

You need a clean separation of layers:
	1.	Navbar (fixed)
	2.	Page Header (sticky or fixed relative to viewport)
	3.	Scrollable content

Right now, you have:

<div class="main-content fixed">
  <div class="page-header">...</div>   ← This is failing to stay pinned
  <div class="reflections-container overflow-y-auto">...</div>
</div>

This hierarchy is flawed. Here’s the correct architectural model:

✅ New Layout Skeleton (Fixed-Then-Sticky)

HTML (simplified):

<body>
  <div class="navbar fixed-top">Navbar</div>

  <div class="page-header sticky-header">Your Reflections</div>

  <div class="scrollable-content"> <!-- independent scroll container -->
    ... your reflections content ...
  </div>
</body>


⸻

✅ CSS:

body {
  margin: 0;
  padding-top: 70px; /* navbar height */
  height: 100vh;
  overflow: hidden; /* prevent body scroll */
}

.sticky-header {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  background: white;
  z-index: 99;
  padding: 1rem;
  box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}

.scrollable-content {
  height: calc(100vh - 70px - 60px); /* minus navbar and header height */
  overflow-y: auto;
  padding: 1rem;
}


⸻

⚠️ Notes:
	•	Do not wrap everything in a single fixed container — that breaks the scroll context for sticky.
	•	The only thing that should be fixed is the navbar.
	•	Header should be sticky — but it must live inside a container that can scroll.
	•	The scrollable content must have a height constrained by vh, not 100%.

⸻

✅ Quick Sanity Check:

Inspect layout in browser dev tools:
	•	Confirm .scrollable-content has overflow-y: auto
	•	Confirm .sticky-header is directly above .scrollable-content in DOM hierarchy
	•	Ensure .page-header does not sit inside a position: fixed parent

⸻

Final Verdict:

Until you break out of the “fixed parent container” layout, no amount of CSS patching will fix this. You must rebuild the structure so that:
	•	Sticky lives in a scrollable context
	•	Scrollable context is isolated and bounded in height
	•	Fixed elements stay outside this structure
