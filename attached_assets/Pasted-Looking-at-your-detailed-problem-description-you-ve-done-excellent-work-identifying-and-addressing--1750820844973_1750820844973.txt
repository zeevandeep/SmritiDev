Looking at your detailed problem description, you've done excellent work identifying and addressing the major causes. The intermittent nature suggests there's likely an **asynchronous timing issue** where something is triggering a scroll after your reset completes.

Here are the most likely remaining culprits and a comprehensive solution:

## Remaining Potential Causes

1. **Layout shifts during content rendering** - Even with `display: block/none`, content height changes can trigger scroll adjustments
2. **Intersection Observer or other scroll-related APIs** - These can queue scroll events that fire after your reset
3. **CSS transitions/animations** - These can be initiated by the display property changes
4. **Browser's "scroll restoration"** - Modern browsers try to maintain scroll positions across dynamic content changes
5. **Delayed image loading or dynamic content** - Causing layout shifts after your monitoring period ends

## Definitive Solution## Key Improvements in This Solution

1. **Comprehensive Event Blocking** - Temporarily blocks ALL scroll-related events (`scroll`, `wheel`, `touchmove`, `keydown`) during transitions

2. **Multiple Reset Methods** - Uses `scrollTop`, `scrollTo()`, and even `transform` as fallbacks

3. **Extended Monitoring with Exponential Backoff** - Monitors for 500ms with more frequent checks initially (10ms) then less frequent (50ms)

4. **Frame-Based DOM Updates** - Uses `requestAnimationFrame` to ensure DOM changes happen at optimal times

5. **Transition State Management** - Adds a `transitioning` class to disable CSS animations/transitions during pagination

6. **Visibility + Display Control** - Uses both `display` and `visibility` to prevent layout shifts

## Quick Test

Replace your current `showPage` function with the one above and add the CSS. If you want to be extra cautious, use `showPageEnhanced` instead.

## Nuclear Option

If the above still doesn't work 100%, there's one more aggressive approach - temporarily clone the container:

```javascript
// Create a fresh container, populate it, then replace the original
const newContainer = scrollableContent.cloneNode(false);
// ... populate newContainer with correct items ...
scrollableContent.parentNode.replaceChild(newContainer, scrollableContent);
```

This would eliminate any possibility of inherited scroll state, but it's quite heavy-handed.

The solution I've provided should handle the remaining edge cases. The key insight is that something asynchronous is still triggering scrolls after your monitoring period, so we need longer monitoring with event blocking during the critical transition period.
