You're right to question the debugging process here. Replit's agent is cycling through implementation without addressing the underlying issue, which is not about shared CSS at all, but about layout context and JavaScript behavior specific to the Reflections page.

Let‚Äôs walk through the actual technical failure based on your logs and compare expected vs actual behavior:

‚úÖ What We Know:
Navbar and hamburger menu work on all other pages.

Same shared navbar.css is used across all pages, including Reflections.

The agent keeps changing CSS globally, which is not needed.

Reflections page is the only one with issues, meaning the problem is local to that page‚Äôs layout or JS behavior.

üß† Final Root Cause Summary
Despite CSS cleanup, here's why the hamburger menu is still broken on Reflections:

üß® 1. Navbar Collapse Element Is Outside Scroll Context
Even if position: absolute is removed, if the navbar-collapse container ends up outside the visible scrolling context, it will collapse but appear invisible (clipped out of view).

üß® 2. Still Conflicting Scroll Handling or Container Constraints
Even though the agent removed scrollable-content, they likely didn't fully revert the page to normal document flow. Possibilities:

The navbar might still be in a separate positioning context.

Body may still have height: 100vh somewhere else (e.g., via style tags or inline style).

Collapse may visually work, but JS listeners or layout clipping make it appear broken.

üß® 3. Improper Placement of navbar-collapse in DOM
If navbar-collapse is not directly inside the standard Bootstrap .navbar structure, it won't expand correctly. Even a missing container class can cause unexpected overflow behavior.

‚úÖ What You Should Ask Replit Agent to Do (Next Step, Precisely):
‚ÄúReplit, I want you to inspect the DOM of the Reflections page when the hamburger is clicked. Confirm whether the .navbar-collapse is receiving the .show class, and check whether it is visible on screen (not clipped, zero height, or off-canvas). Do not edit anything‚Äîjust debug visibility and layout placement live using dev tools.‚Äù
