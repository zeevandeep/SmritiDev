üìù Node Creation Prompt (Refined)

You are processing a raw text from a journaling session. The goal is to break this text into meaningful nodes, each representing a distinct theme or cognitive pattern. Use the provided lists of themes, cognition types, and emotions for guidance. Each node should capture a coherent thought or emotional segment related to a specific theme. **Each theme should have at most one node per session.**

Session Text:  
"{transcript}"

Themes: ["relationships", "career", "self-worth", "family", "health", "purpose", "money", "identity", "growth", "change", "conflict", "spirituality", "creativity", "freedom", "generic"]

Cognition Types: ["decision_intent", "self_reflection", "emotion_insight", "identity_question", "future_projection", "regret", "justification", "resignation", "generic"]

Emotions: ["confident", "uncertain", "hopeful", "anxious", "angry", "frustrated", "guilty", "disconnected", "determined", "fearful", "content", "overwhelmed", "inspired", "doubtful", "peaceful", "disappointed", "insecure", "introspective", "resentful", "grateful", "generic"]

Instructions:

1. **Node Segmentation:** Break the text into distinct, coherent nodes, each representing a single theme. **Each theme should have at most one node per session.**

2. **Theme Deduplication:** If multiple sentences in the session text match the same theme, select the **most contextually rich** or **emotionally significant** passage to represent that theme. **Do not create more than one node per theme.**

3. **Emotion Consistency:** Assign an **emotion** to each node based on the overall tone of the selected text segment, not just the immediate phrase. Use the provided emotion list.

4. **Contextual Merging:** If multiple related sentences fit a single theme (e.g., reflections on values and life purpose), merge them into a single, context-rich node.

5. **Generic Fallback:** If no clear match is found for a theme, cognition type, or emotion, use the **generic** category as a fallback.

6. **Avoid Exact Duplicates:** Ensure that each part of the text belongs to only one node. Do not include the same sentence in multiple nodes, even if it seems to fit multiple themes.

7. **Output Format:** Return the nodes in JSON format, including all necessary fields for our database schema.

Example Response:

[
  {
    "text": "I need to focus on my priorities and make meaningful changes.",
    "theme": "purpose",
    "cognition_type": "decision_intent",
    "emotion": "determined"
  },
  {
    "text": "I've been questioning my role at work and whether this career path is truly fulfilling.",
    "theme": "career",
    "cognition_type": "identity_question",
    "emotion": "uncertain"
  },
  {
    "text": "I feel disconnected from my family lately. I realize I haven't been making enough time for them.",
    "theme": "family",
    "cognition_type": "self_reflection",
    "emotion": "guilty"
  }
]

Special Cases:  
- **Conflicting Sentences:** If a sentence fits multiple themes, select the theme that captures the **core intent** or **dominant tone** of the passage.  
- **Emotion Overlap:** If a passage clearly expresses two different emotions (e.g., **hopeful** but also **anxious**), select the more **dominant** or **recurrent** emotional tone.  
- **Fallback Handling:** If a passage is too ambiguous to fit a specific theme, cognition type, or emotion, categorize it as **generic**.
