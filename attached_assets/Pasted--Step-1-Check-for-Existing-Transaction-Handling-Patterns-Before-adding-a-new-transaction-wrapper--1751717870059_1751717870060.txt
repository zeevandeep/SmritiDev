✅ Step 1: Check for Existing Transaction Handling Patterns
Before adding a new transaction wrapper, answer this:

🔍 Is your app already using DB transactions during signup or similar critical flows (e.g., login with profile audit, password reset, etc.)?

Where to look:

Any use of with Session.begin(): or async with session.begin(): (for SQLAlchemy)

Any decorators or wrappers like @db_transactional or @atomic

Manual commits: db.commit() followed by rollback on except

If you see those, replicate that exact style — consistency > cleverness.

✅ Step 2: If No Existing Transaction Pattern Exists
If the current code creates the user and profile with separate db.add() calls and commit(), then you should introduce a scoped transaction — but gently, without changing the architecture too much.

Example — Sync SQLAlchemy
python
Copy
Edit
def signup(...):
    try:
        with Session.begin():  # atomic block
            user = create_user(...)
            profile = create_profile(user.id)
            # No need to manually commit here — it's automatic on success
    except Exception as e:
        # Log error, return appropriate response
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Signup failed")
Example — Async SQLAlchemy
python
Copy
Edit
async def signup(...):
    async with async_session() as session:
        async with session.begin():  # rollback on failure
            user = await create_user(...)
            profile = await create_profile(user.id)
🎯 Goal: Ensure that if any one part fails (user, profile, token logic, etc.), the database state remains clean — no half-created records.

✅ Step 3: Token Generation Should Happen After DB Commit (or Inside Transaction)
Token generation is typically not DB-related, so you can safely do this:

python
Copy
Edit
with Session.begin():
    user = create_user()
    profile = create_profile(user)

# Now generate tokens and set cookies
access_token, refresh_token = create_jwt_tokens(user.id)
response.set_cookie(..., value=access_token)
response.set_cookie(..., value=refresh_token)
❗Don't generate tokens before the user is fully committed to DB — or you might issue tokens for a user that doesn't persist if something fails.

✅ Step 4: Checklist for Final Implementation Plan
Task	Action
🔍 Identify signup route	Look for /signup, register, or UserCreate usage
🔁 Reuse token logic	Use create_jwt_tokens() or equivalent from login
🍪 Copy cookie logic	Match httponly, secure, samesite settings
🧱 Add transaction scope	Match existing DB transaction pattern, or use Session.begin()
🧹 Rollback on error	Ensure all or nothing: no user without profile, no tokens for partial data
✅ Keep response consistent	Just add token/cookie logic — no need to change response format unless necessary
