1. Request Host Detection Timing
Recommendation:
✅ Move redirect URI determination into get_authorization_url(request) and pass request explicitly.

python
Copy
Edit
def get_authorization_url(self, request: Request) -> Tuple[str, str]:
    redirect_uri = self._resolve_redirect_uri(request)
    ...
Why this is best:

Keeps the __init__() clean and stateless.

Ensures you're working with live request context.

Makes unit testing easier (you can mock request objects directly).

✅ 2. Environment Variable Names
Recommendation:
✅ Use GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI_DEV and GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI_PROD

Why:

Clear and predictable.

Aligns with ENV=development/production

Mirrors standard naming conventions (easy for others to understand)

Alternative like GOOGLE_OAUTH_DEV_CALLBACK is fine but more verbose with no added benefit.

✅ 3. Dev Domain Detection Logic
Recommendation:
✅ Match all three patterns:

localhost (for local testing)

*.replit.dev (Replit workspace/dev)

*.replit.app with --dev in subdomain (Replit preview/dev mode)

Suggested logic:

python
Copy
Edit
host = request.headers.get("host", "")
if "localhost" in host or ".replit.dev" in host or "--dev" in host:
    return os.getenv("GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI_DEV")
else:
    return os.getenv("GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI_PROD")
✅ 4. ENV Variable Usage
Recommendation:
Use ENV environment variable if set, but also support domain auto-detection fallback.

Best of both worlds:

python
Copy
Edit
env = os.getenv("ENV", None)
if env == "production":
    return os.getenv("GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI_PROD")
elif env == "development":
    return os.getenv("GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI_DEV")
else:
    # fallback to domain-based detection
Why:

Lets you override in edge cases (e.g., staging, CI/CD)

Still works if ENV isn’t set (i.e., no surprises)

✅ 5. Error Handling
Recommendation:
✅ Yes, include a clear actionable message in the error if detection fails.

python
Copy
Edit
raise RuntimeError(
    "OAuth redirect URI could not be determined.\n"
    "Set ENV=production or ENV=development in your Replit secrets, "
    "and ensure GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI_DEV / PROD are set accordingly."
)
