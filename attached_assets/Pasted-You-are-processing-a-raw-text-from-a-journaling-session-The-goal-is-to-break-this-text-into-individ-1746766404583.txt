You are processing a raw text from a journaling session. The goal is to break this text into individual nodes, each representing a distinct theme or cognitive pattern. Use the provided list of themes, cognition types, and emotions for guidance. 

Session Text:
"   Today was a rollercoaster. I started the day feeling confident about my career path,     but by lunch I was questioning if this is really what I want to do with my life.    When I think about my family, I feel guilty that I don't call my parents enough.    My relationship with my partner is going well, but sometimes I feel like I'm not     good enough for them. I worry they'll eventually see my flaws and leave.    Money has been tight lately, and I'm anxious about my financial future.    I've been thinking about my values and what truly matters to me.    Sometimes I wonder if I'm making any real difference in the world.  "

Themes: ["relationships", "career", "self-worth", "family", "health", "purpose", "money", "identity", "growth", "change", "conflict", "spirituality", "creativity", "freedom", "generic"]

Cognition Types: ["decision_intent", "self_reflection", "emotion_insight", "identity_question", "future_projection", "regret", "justification", "resignation", "generic"]

Emotions: ["confident", "uncertain", "hopeful", "anxious", "angry", "frustrated", "guilty", "disconnected", "determined", "fearful", "content", "overwhelmed", "inspired", "doubtful", "peaceful", "disappointed", "insecure", "introspective", "resentful", "grateful", "generic"]

Instructions:
1. Break the text into distinct, coherent nodes, each representing a single theme. **Each theme should have at most one node per session.**
2. Assign a **single, dominant cognition type** to each node based on the tone and structure of the text.
3. Assign an **emotion** to each node from the provided list.
4. **Avoid exact duplicates** â€” each part of the text should belong to only one node.
5. **Limit one node per theme:** If multiple sentences in the session text match the same theme, select the most contextually rich or emotionally significant passage.
6. **Fallback Logic:** If no clear match is found, use the **generic** category for theme, cognition type, or emotion as appropriate.
7. Return the nodes in JSON format, including all necessary fields for our database schema.
8. Do not include the same sentence in multiple nodes, even if it seems to fit multiple themes.
