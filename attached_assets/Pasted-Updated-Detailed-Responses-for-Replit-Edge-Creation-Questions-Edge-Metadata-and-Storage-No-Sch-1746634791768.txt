Updated, Detailed Responses for Replit Edge Creation Questions

⸻

Edge Metadata and Storage (No Schema Changes)

Current State:
	•	The current metadata includes from_node_id, to_node_id, edge_type, match_strength, and explanation. You’ve already made it clear that we are not modifying the schema, so this will remain unchanged for now.

Decision:
	•	No schema changes. We will handle any additional context (like emotional families) outside the database to avoid schema bloat and maintain flexibility for future features like memory anchors.

Testing Strategy

Metrics for Edge Quality:
	•	Precision and Recall: Use small test sets with known relationships for validation.
	•	Edge Density Checks: Ensure edge creation isn’t generating excessive or noisy connections.
	•	Chain Completeness: Validate that edges form meaningful chains (e.g., 3+ edges as minimum chain length).
	•	Latency and Cost Control: Measure response time and cost per node pair to ensure scalability.

Test Cases:
	•	Basic Cases: Each edge type should be tested individually (e.g., thought progression, emotion shift).
	•	Complex Cases: Test mixed edge chains, cross-session paths, and edge types influenced by emotional families.
	•	Failure Cases: Ensure nodes without clear connections are properly excluded.

Neo4j Schema Design

Current Plan:
	•	We will not integrate Neo4j at this stage, but will keep the option open for post-MVP. You have indicated this is for future memory anchor processing, not for immediate edge storage.

Recommendation:
	•	Keep Neo4j for phase 2 of scaling, when you want more advanced path finding, clustering, and graph-based insights. For now, stick to the relational database for simpler, lower-latency queries.

API Design

Endpoint Strategy:
	•	Separate Edge API:
	•	POST /edges – Create edges
	•	GET /edges/{edge_id} – Retrieve single edge
	•	GET /edges/session/{session_id} – Retrieve all edges within a session
	•	GET /edges/user/{user_id} – Retrieve all edges for a user
	•	DELETE /edges/{edge_id} – Delete a specific edge

Debug Endpoints:
	•	GET /edges/unprocessed – Identify nodes without edges
	•	GET /edges/errors – Retrieve problematic edges

Concurrency and Performance (Simplified as per XML)

Current Understanding:
	•	No Concurrency Needed for Single Users: You’ve clearly indicated that we process one user at a time, pulling all their nodes and creating edges in a single batch. This is clearly shown in the draw.io diagram.

Batch Processing Logic:
	•	Batch Size: 6+4 (6 intra-session, 4 cross-session), as previously discussed.
	•	Single User Scope: Only process nodes for a single user at a time to avoid unnecessary queue management.
	•	No Task Queues: Given the single-user batch approach, task queues like Redis are not needed at this stage.

⸻

Failure Handling (Without Schema Change)

Retry Logic:
	•	Exponential Backoff: If a node fails to form an edge, retry 2-3 times with increasing delay before marking it as problematic.
	•	Error Tracking:
	•	No Schema Change: Keep error tracking in logs, not in the database, to avoid schema bloat.
	•	Periodic Cleanup: Schedule cleanup tasks to retry failed edges every 24 hours.

⸻

Edge Relevance Over Time (Future Consideration)

Current Decision:
	•	No Relevance Decay for Now: Given your preference for a locked schema, we won’t introduce dynamic edge aging or decay yet.
	•	Future Consideration:
	•	Once memory anchors are implemented, this can be revisited.
	•	Use local files or in-memory caches for temporary edge priority tracking.

⸻

Similarity Calculation (Based on Diagram)

Current Plan:
	•	Use Cosine Similarity as the base metric for node embedding comparisons.
	•	Set a 0.8 Threshold for strong semantic matches, reducing API costs by filtering weak edges early.

Batch Size and API Rate Limiting:
	•	Batch Size: 6 intra-session + 4 cross-session nodes per user per batch, as clearly indicated in the XML.
	•	Rate Limiting:
	•	Use exponential backoff if rate limits are hit.
	•	Consider splitting large batches to avoid long delays.
