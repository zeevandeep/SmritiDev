Detailed Steps for Reflection Generation (Phase 5)
Initial Setup
Create a temporary list (TempList1) by selecting all records from the edges table where is_processed = false, ordered by user_id and timestamp in descending order.
Process for Each User
For each unique user_id in TempList1:
Filter TempList1 to create TempList2 containing only records for the current user_id.
Process for Each Unprocessed Edge
For each unprocessed edge in TempList2:
Select the current record as the starting point for building a chain.
Initialize a ReflectionNodes list and add the to_node of the current record.
Set temprecord = current record (the starting unprocessed edge).
Chain Building
Begin chain building process:

Fetch all edges from the database where user_id equals the current user's ID to create TempList3.
Save the from_node of temprecord to the ReflectionNodes list.
Find edges in TempList3 where the to_node matches the from_node of temprecord to create TempList4.
For edge selection when multiple edges have the same to_node:

Calculate a combined score: combined_score = match_strength + (recency_factor * decay_value)
Where decay_value = 1.0 / (1.0 + (days_since_creation / 7.0))
Select the edge with the highest combined score, or if tied, the most recent one.
If matching edges are found in TempList4:

Update temprecord to the selected edge from TempList4.
Continue the chain building process from step 4.
Stop when either no more connections are found or the chain reaches 5 nodes.
If no matching edges are found:

End the chain building process for this starting edge.
Reflection Generation
When chain building is complete for an edge:

Query the nodes table to retrieve complete information for all nodes in the ReflectionNodes list.
Sort the nodes by created_at in ascending order to maintain chronological sequence.
Prepare the GPT prompt:

Include the sequence of node texts.
Include relevant attributes: cognition types, themes, emotions.
Include edge types if available.
Send the prepared prompt to the OpenAI API for reflection generation.

Process the API response:

Extract the generated reflection text.
Extract the confidence score.
Save to the database:

Create a new record in the reflections table.
Include the user_id, node_ids, edge_ids, generated text, and confidence score.
Set is_reflected = false (this would be updated to true when user views the reflection).
Clear the ReflectionNodes list and return to step 3 to process the next unprocessed edge.

Process Completion
After processing all unprocessed edges for all users:
Update all edges in the database to set is_processed = true.
Clear all temporary lists and tables.
Additional Details
This process only considers edges where is_processed = false as starting points.
These would be new edges formed after Phase 3.25 (Edge Post-processing).
The recency factor is a fixed weight (e.g., 0.3) to balance importance between match_strength and recency.
No minimum number of nodes is required to generate a reflection.
All reflections are stored regardless of confidence score.
This is designed to be a batch process triggered manually after Phase 3.25.
