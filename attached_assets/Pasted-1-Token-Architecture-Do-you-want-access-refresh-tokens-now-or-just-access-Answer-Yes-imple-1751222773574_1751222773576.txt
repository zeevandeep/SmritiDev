1. Token Architecture
Do you want access + refresh tokens now, or just access?

‚úÖ Answer:
Yes, implement both access and refresh tokens from the start.

Access token: short-lived (15‚Äì30 min)

Refresh token: long-lived (7‚Äì14 days), stored securely in an HTTP-only cookie

This gives users a smooth experience without re-logging every 30 minutes, which would frustrate journalers.

Rationale:
Your app isn't just a one-click login ‚Äî users will return daily, and seamless re-auth matters. Refresh token support will also make Google OAuth smoother later.

2. Token Storage Strategy
Do you want Redis/token blacklisting now?

‚úÖ Answer:
No, not in Phase 1. Keep it stateless for now.

You can defer blacklisting/token revocation until you have:

Log out functionality

Admin controls (like forced logouts)

Multiple devices per user

Rationale:
Stateless JWTs are scalable and simple to deploy. Redis introduces infra complexity and isn‚Äôt needed until you need fine-grained control over token invalidation.

3. Migration Approach
Migrate users to JWT immediately or run both systems in parallel?

‚úÖ Answer:
Migrate on next login. No need for parallel systems.

When a user logs in, issue JWT and stop using Flask session.

Keep login logic backward-compatible (same password hash, same DB schema).

This avoids managing two auth systems at once.

Rationale:
Your current user base is small and adaptable ‚Äî seamless transition is fine. The Flask session system can be safely deprecated once JWT is in.

4. Security Level
Full production security (jti, blacklist) now, or just basic JWT?

‚úÖ Answer:
Start with secure JWT implementation but skip blacklisting/jti tracking for now.

Use secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookies

Validate expiry + signature on every request

Skip jti or token revocation ‚Äî not critical until logout or password-reset flows exist.

Rationale:
You need secure-by-default, not overbuilt. Advanced features like jti tracking are only needed when your app has sessions that must be forcibly expired.

5. Dev vs Production Config
Different token expiry in dev/prod and env-based config?

‚úÖ Answer:
Yes ‚Äî set up .env-based config now.

Example:

env
Copy
Edit
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY=1800   # 30 mins
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=1209600  # 14 days
FLASK_ENV=development
Then in config:

python
Copy
Edit
import os
ACCESS_EXP = int(os.getenv("ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY", 1800))
Rationale:
Clean separation now will avoid messy rework later. Also helps when you deploy to different environments (e.g., staging vs prod).

üîß Final Recommendation for Phase 1
Implement:

‚úÖ Access + refresh token setup

‚úÖ JWT stored in secure HTTP-only cookies

‚úÖ Environment-based token expiry config

‚ùå No Redis or blacklisting yet

‚ùå No session-based auth fallback

‚úÖ Migrate users to JWT on next login

‚úÖ Use simple DB model: user_id ‚Üí token metadata (optional)

This balances speed, security, and future extensibility ‚Äî and is a great Phase 1.
