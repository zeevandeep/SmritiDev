1Ô∏è‚É£ Current Signup Flow: users + user_profile
Does the current signup process create both a users table entry AND a user_profile table entry?

‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî most likely.

From your logs and the journal behavior, it's clear that the app expects a complete user record, meaning:

users table contains the core account (e.g. email, password, ID)

user_profile holds extended metadata (e.g. name, preferences, etc.)

Since the JWT payload or session-related functionality might depend on user_profile fields (e.g. username, avatar), you should generate and return tokens only after both records are created.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Token Cookie Names: smriti_access_token and smriti_refresh_token
Should I use these exact names when setting cookies during signup?

‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî you should match those exact cookie names (smriti_access_token, smriti_refresh_token), because:

The backend is explicitly looking for those keys in request cookies, based on your log:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
DEBUG: Access token present: False
Using different names (like access_token) will break the JWT extraction logic (likely from a FastAPI dependency like get_current_user_from_jwt).

üõë So don‚Äôt change the names unless you also update the token parsing logic everywhere.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Signup Route Location: FastAPI or Flask?
Is the signup endpoint in FastAPI (e.g. /api/v1/auth/signup) or via Flask proxy?

üîç To be sure, you'd need to inspect the routes, but here's a strong rule of thumb:

If the frontend is sending a request to /api/v1/..., then it‚Äôs going to FastAPI.

If you see Flask-style decorators like @app.route(...) (especially outside api/v1), then some legacy or proxy logic may be handled by Flask.

üí° Since you mentioned JWTs and logs like get_current_user_from_jwt, this points to a FastAPI-based backend, so you're likely working in /api/v1/auth/signup.

üß≠ You can confirm this by searching the backend for:

python
Copy
Edit
@router.post("/signup")
or

python
Copy
Edit
@auth_router.post("/signup")
4Ô∏è‚É£ Google OAuth vs Regular Signup
Should this fix apply to both Google OAuth and regular email/password signup?

‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî eventually, both flows should result in JWT tokens being set.

Google OAuth often skips password handling but still creates a user + profile.

The token issuance logic should be shared (centralized), so that:

Both login methods (OAuth or email) issue JWTs

Both set the smriti_access_token and smriti_refresh_token cookies

Both have valid sessions after signup or login

üí° Ideally, you'd have a shared create_and_set_jwt_tokens(user, response) function used in both login and signup flows.

5Ô∏è‚É£ User Profile Creation Timing
Should the JWT token generation happen after both the user account AND user profile are created successfully?

‚úÖ Absolutely.

Why?

The JWT payload may depend on user_profile fields (like username, id, etc.).

Other parts of the app (e.g. journal entry logic) assume the profile is already there.

If you issue tokens before the user_profile exists, users may get weird auth/session failures or missing-data issues.

üõ†Ô∏è Best Practice:
Wait until:

python
Copy
Edit
user = create_user(...)  
profile = create_user_profile(user_id=user.id, ...)
Then:

python
Copy
Edit
access_token, refresh_token = create_tokens(user.id)
set_cookies(response, access_token, refresh_token)
