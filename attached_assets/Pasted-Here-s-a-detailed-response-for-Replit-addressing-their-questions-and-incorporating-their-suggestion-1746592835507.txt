‚úÖ Smriti Backend ‚Äì Additional Setup Clarifications

‚∏ª

1. Dependency Management

Recommended Approach: Docker (Preferred) + virtualenv (local dev)

Rationale: Docker provides environment consistency across dev, test, and production, while virtualenv allows for quick local testing without container overhead.

Requirements:
	‚Ä¢	Dockerfile for production
	‚Ä¢	docker-compose.yml for local testing with PostgreSQL and Neo4j
	‚Ä¢	requirements.txt or Pipfile for local virtualenv

‚∏ª

2. API Documentation

Planned for Phase 1: Yes, we will include OpenAPI documentation.

Tool: FastAPI has built-in Swagger (/docs) and ReDoc (/redoc) support, which can be enabled from the start.

Environment Variable (Optional):

ENABLE_API_DOCS=true



‚∏ª

3. Error Handling Strategy

Initial Plan: Centralized exception handling using FastAPI‚Äôs middleware.

Future Plan:
	‚Ä¢	Unified error handling with custom ExceptionHandlers
	‚Ä¢	Logging of all errors to a separate error log file
	‚Ä¢	Optional integration with a service like Sentry for real-time alerts

‚∏ª

4. Monitoring & Logging

Initial Plan: Basic logging using Python‚Äôs logging module.

Future Plan:
	‚Ä¢	Add performance metrics (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)
	‚Ä¢	Include API usage tracking for OpenAI calls
	‚Ä¢	Consider opentelemetry for distributed tracing if scaling rapidly

‚∏ª

5. Database Migration Strategy

Tool: Alembic for PostgreSQL migrations, Neo4j Migrations for graph DB.

Reason: Ensures consistent schema across dev, staging, and production.

‚∏ª

6. Testing Integration

Approach: Parallel test development in each phase.

Tools:
	‚Ä¢	Unit tests with pytest
	‚Ä¢	API contract tests with pytest-httpx
	‚Ä¢	Neo4j integration tests

‚∏ª

7. Authentication Implementation (Post-MVP)

Approach: JWT-based authentication for secure API access.

Integration: Can be added as a middleware, with options for:
	‚Ä¢	JWT for API
	‚Ä¢	OAuth2 for web clients (if needed later)

‚∏ª

8. Data Validation

Initial Plan: Use Pydantic for request/response models in FastAPI to validate incoming data.

Future Plan: Add custom validation for node, edge, and reflection formats to prevent GPT hallucinations.

‚∏ª

9. Batch Processing

Required: Yes, for cost control and scalability.

Components:
	‚Ä¢	Batch node, edge, and reflection creation
	‚Ä¢	Bulk embedding requests to reduce OpenAI costs

‚∏ª

üìù Final Recommendation
	‚Ä¢	Add a Dockerfile for consistent environment setup.
	‚Ä¢	Use Alembic for managing PostgreSQL schema changes.
	‚Ä¢	Plan for batch processing early to avoid cost overruns.
	‚Ä¢	Consider adding API rate limiting for OpenAI calls to control costs.
