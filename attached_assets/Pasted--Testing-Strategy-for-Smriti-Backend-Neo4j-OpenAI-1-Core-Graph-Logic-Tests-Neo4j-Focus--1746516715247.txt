✅ Testing Strategy for Smriti Backend (Neo4j + OpenAI)
🔍 1. 
Core Graph Logic Tests (Neo4j)
Focus: Validate graph construction, traversal, and mutation logic
Test Cases to Cover:
Node creation:


✅ New node gets inserted with correct labels + properties


✅ Proper user/session linkage exists


Edge creation:


✅ Correct relationship type is added (e.g., BELIEF_MUTATION)


✅ Direction of edges is valid (past ➝ present)


Edge chain creation:


✅ Chain contains valid node and edge sequences


✅ Max length (7 nodes) is respected


✅ Deep edge types are detected correctly


Backtracking:


✅ Given a new node, backtrack to correct historical chain


✅ Detect multiple parent paths


Tools:
Unit tests using pytest or unittest


Neo4j test container (optional, for isolated test DB)



🧠 2. 
OpenAI Prompt Response Tests
Focus: Validate structure, coherence, and consistency of GPT responses
Test Cases to Cover:
Node creation:


✅ Response contains emotion, theme, belief, cognition type


✅ JSON is well-formed, all required fields present


Edge detection:


✅ Edges contain proper type, explanation, and confidence score


✅ Self-referential or duplicate edges are excluded


Reflection generation:


✅ Reflection text is within token limits


✅ Chain summary logic matches themes and edge context


Tools:
Mock GPT responses using static JSON for CI/CD


Real GPT tests only in staging environment (with logging)



⚙️ 3. 
End-to-End Functional Tests
Focus: Verify the full pipeline works from session ➝ node ➝ edge ➝ reflection
Scenarios:
A single journal entry creates multiple nodes


New node triggers edge matching with prior thoughts


Edge chains are formed and saved


Valid edge chains trigger reflection generation


Reflection is saved and marked unshown


Optional:
Add tests for rate limit handling and GPT failure fallback



🧪 Testing Guidelines
Run core logic tests on every commit (GitHub Actions or Replit’s test tab)


Isolate OpenAI calls unless explicitly testing them


Maintain test coverage ≥ 80% for business logic (excluding GPT)
