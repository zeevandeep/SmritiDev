✅ 1. JWT Token Generation Function
Q: Is there already a create_jwt_tokens() or similar function that I should reuse?

Yes, you should absolutely reuse the exact same token generation function used during login. This ensures:

Same expiration durations

Same signing secret and algorithm

Same token structure (sub claim, user ID, etc.)

🔍 How to confirm:
Look inside your login route (e.g. /login, /token, etc.) and trace:

The function used to generate tokens

How they are set into cookies

What response format is returned

✅ Reuse: create_access_token, create_refresh_token, or any wrapper around them like create_jwt_tokens().

✅ 2. Cookie Security Settings
Q: Should I match the exact httponly, secure, samesite settings from login flow?

Absolutely. Inconsistencies here can break authentication silently or introduce security issues.

httponly=True: Prevents JS from accessing the token

secure=True: Sends cookie only over HTTPS

samesite="Lax" or "Strict": Controls cross-site behavior

📌 Copy the cookie settings from the login route exactly.

❗ If you forget secure=True on production (https://smriti.app), the cookies may silently not be sent by the browser.

✅ 3. Error Handling During Signup
Q: If user creation or user_profile creation fails, should I roll back?

Yes — treat signup as a transactional unit. Either everything succeeds (user + profile + tokens), or nothing gets committed.

You can:

Use a DB transaction if you're on Postgres (e.g. with Session.begin())

Or at least use try/except blocks and delete partial data if one step fails

✅ Best UX: Avoid orphaned users with no profiles or incomplete auth states

✅ 4. Signup Route Discovery
Q: How to locate the right route to modify?

Look for routes like:

@router.post("/signup") or /register

Functions using a schema like UserCreate or CreateUserSchema

Search terms: create_user, register_user, or any calls to db.add(user)

🔍 Also check if signup is split into multiple steps (user → profile → extras), or if it’s unified.

✅ 5. Response Format
Q: Should signup response format change, or just add cookie logic?

No need to change the response structure. Just add cookie-setting to the existing logic.

Unless the frontend is expecting a specific message (like "User created successfully"), keep the structure the same to avoid breaking anything.
