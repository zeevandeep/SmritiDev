üìù Instructions for Replit: Emotional Family Context for Edge Creation

üîÑ Context for Edge Creation (Emotion Families and Edge Types)
To effectively create edges between nodes in the Smriti app, we need to introduce the concept of Emotional Families. This approach helps group related emotions into broader categories, making the edge creation logic more consistent and structured. It also reduces the overall token cost by avoiding long lists of individual emotions in each GPT call.

1. üóÇÔ∏è Emotional Family Structure
Emotions are grouped into predefined families to reduce token overhead and ensure more accurate edge creation. For example:
Fear: anxious, terrified, worried, scared, panic, nervous


Anger: frustrated, irritated, furious, enraged, resentful


Sadness: disappointed, depressed, hopeless, miserable, guilty


Joy: happy, excited, content, proud, grateful


Surprise: shocked, astonished, startled, amazed, confused


Trust: confident, assured, secure, faithful, reliable


Anticipation: hopeful, curious, expectant, eager, optimistic


Disgust: repulsed, revolted, disdainful, contemptuous, nauseated



2. üìÇ Storage Method
Instead of including these emotional families in every API call, the mapping will be stored in a separate configuration file or a Python dictionary in the backend, like:
EMOTIONAL_FAMILIES = {
    "Fear": ["anxious", "terrified", "worried", "scared", "panic", "nervous"],
    "Anger": ["frustrated", "irritated", "furious", "enraged", "resentful"],
    "Sadness": ["disappointed", "depressed", "hopeless", "miserable", "guilty"],
    "Joy": ["happy", "excited", "content", "proud", "grateful"],
    "Surprise": ["shocked", "astonished", "startled", "amazed", "confused"],
    "Trust": ["confident", "assured", "secure", "faithful", "reliable"],
    "Anticipation": ["hopeful", "curious", "expectant", "eager", "optimistic"],
    "Disgust": ["repulsed", "revolted", "disdainful", "contemptuous", "nauseated"]
}
This mapping can be stored in:
A JSON file for easy updates


A Python dictionary for fast in-memory lookup


A Redis cache for large-scale deployments



3. ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Integration
When a node is created, the raw emotion is mapped to its corresponding emotional family before being passed to the GPT model for edge creation. This reduces token usage and keeps the emotional context consistent.

4. üìä Benefits of this Approach
Token Efficiency: Lower token count per GPT call, reducing costs.


Consistency: Ensures similar emotions are treated as part of the same family, improving edge classification.


Scalability: Easier to expand emotional families without changing core logic.


Customization: Allows for future fine-tuning based on user feedback.



5. üîó Next Steps for Edge Creation
Once this emotional family context is established, the edge creation logic can be built around these families, making it easier to detect:
Emotion Shifts: Transitions between different emotional families.


Thought Progressions: Linear emotional shifts within the same family.


Contradiction Loops: Emotional back-and-forth within the same family or across conflicting families.
