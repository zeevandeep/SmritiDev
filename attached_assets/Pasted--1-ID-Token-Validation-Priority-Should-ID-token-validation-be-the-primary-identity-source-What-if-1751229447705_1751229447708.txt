✅ 1. ID Token Validation Priority
Should ID token validation be the primary identity source? What if it fails?

✅ Yes — ID token should be the only trusted identity source.

ID token is a signed JWT issued by Google to prove user identity.

If ID token validation fails, reject the entire login.

Access tokens are meant for accessing Google APIs, not for user identity assertions.

⚠️ Access tokens:

Opaque (not always JWTs)

Might not contain identity info

Can't be validated offline reliably

Conclusion:
✅ Rely only on id_token for email/name/picture
🚫 Do not trust access token for user identity
🚫 Do not continue login if id_token validation fails

✅ 2. Token Exchange Flow
After exchanging the code, how should we use the tokens?

Correct usage:
Token	Purpose
id_token ✅	Identity proof — get email, name, etc.
access_token	Optional — use to fetch additional data if needed (e.g. userinfo endpoint)

Recommended Practice:

Use id_token for identity and core profile fields.

Use access_token only if you need extended profile info (e.g. locale, birthday, Google Drive access — not required in your case).

✅ 3. Error Handling Strategy
If verify_oauth2_token() fails, how should the app respond?

Recommended:

❌ Fail hard on token verification errors — this is a security failure.

✅ Show a generic but user-friendly error:
“We couldn’t sign you in with Google. Please try again or use email login.”

✅ Log the exception (for audit/debugging).

✅ Do not fall back to access_token or retry without user intervention.

Bonus:
You can pass a query param back to /login like ?error=google_oauth_failed and show a custom error message on that page.

✅ 4. User Info Source Priority
Should we only trust id_info, or cross-check with userinfo endpoint?

✅ Trust id_info from the ID token (after validation).

It’s cryptographically signed by Google.

It’s the canonical identity proof in OpenID Connect.

You can optionally call the userinfo endpoint to enrich profile data, but:

Field	Use id_info?	Use userinfo?
Email	✅ Yes	Optionally
Name	✅ Yes	Yes (if updated)
Profile pic	✅ Yes	Yes
Locale, etc.	❌ Not in id	✅ userinfo only

If there’s a mismatch: Trust id_info for anything security-related.

✅ 5. Client ID Validation
What client ID should we use during verify_oauth2_token()?

✅ Use your own GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID.

This ensures:

The token was intended for your app

Prevents token replay attacks from other apps

python
Copy
Edit
id_info = google.oauth2.id_token.verify_oauth2_token(
    id_token,
    google.auth.transport.requests.Request(),
    os.getenv("GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID")  # Must match what your app registered
)
✅ 6. Additional Security Measures
Should we validate aud, exp, iss, etc.?

✅ Yes — here’s what’s automatically handled and what you should confirm:
Claim	Validate?	Notes
aud	✅ Yes	Ensures the token is intended for your app
exp	✅ Yes	Automatically validated by verify_oauth2_token()
iss	✅ Yes	Should be one of:
accounts.google.com or https://accounts.google.com
email_verified	✅ Yes	Only accept identity if Google has verified the user’s email address
