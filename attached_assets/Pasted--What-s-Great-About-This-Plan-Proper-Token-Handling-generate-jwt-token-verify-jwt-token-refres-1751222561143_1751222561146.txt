✅ What’s Great About This Plan
Proper Token Handling

✅ generate_jwt_token, verify_jwt_token, refresh_jwt_token are essential and well-separated.

✅ Using SESSION_SECRET as the signing key is pragmatic — no need to introduce more secrets for now.

Secure Cookie Storage

✅ Using HTTP-only cookies over localStorage avoids common XSS risks.

✅ Including SameSite, Secure, and expiration settings is absolutely correct.

Stateless Architecture

✅ Moving from session-based to stateless JWT auth means the system can scale to mobile, web, APIs without shared memory.

Non-Destructive Migration

✅ Keeping the DB schema intact means no risk of breaking users.

✅ Mapping JWT user_id to existing DB ensures compatibility.

🛠️ Recommended Improvements
1. Split Access vs Refresh Tokens
🔁 Current plan mentions token renewal but doesn’t define refresh tokens.

Why important: Refresh tokens allow silent login renewal without forcing users to re-login after 24h.

✅ Fix: Add generate_refresh_token(user_id) function, store it in DB or Redis with expiry, and issue new access tokens securely.

2. Replay Attack Protection
❗ JWTs are stateless, so revocation is tricky.

✅ Fix: Consider adding a jti (JWT ID) and storing active tokens in a short-lived cache (like Redis). This allows revoking tokens on logout or password change.

3. Cookie Scope Configuration
🚨 Ensure cookie_path and cookie_domain are explicitly set, especially when testing on subdomains or mobile vs web clients.

✅ SameSite=Lax is usually good, but confirm compatibility with Google OAuth in next phase (which may require SameSite=None; Secure).

4. Time Sync Handling
🔄 JWTs rely on client/server clock sync. Add a 1-2 minute leeway (leeway parameter in PyJWT decode) to avoid false “expired” errors.

5. Development Mode Behavior
🧪 In development, allow a fallback mode where token expiry is longer or renewal is easier, but never leak these settings to prod.

✅ Use FLASK_ENV to switch behaviors.

📦 Final Suggestions for Production Readiness
✅ Blacklist refresh tokens on logout

✅ Rotate secrets periodically if long-term sessions are allowed

✅ Audit logging for login, token generation, and refresh events
