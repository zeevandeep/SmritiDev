# SmritiProd

## Overview

SmritiProd is a new application project in its initial setup phase. The repository currently contains minimal structure with basic documentation and security configuration files. The project appears to be prepared for development with security scanning rules configured via Semgrep.

## System Architecture

The system architecture is not yet defined as the project is in its initial setup phase. Based on the repository name and structure, this appears to be a production-ready application framework waiting for implementation.

**Current State:**
- Basic project structure established
- Security scanning configuration in place
- Ready for technology stack implementation

## Key Components

### Security Configuration
- **Semgrep Rules**: Pre-configured security scanning rules focused on Azure Bicep templates
- **Security Focus**: Emphasis on preventing sensitive information leakage in logs and displays

### Project Structure
- **Root Directory**: Contains main project documentation
- **SmritiProd Directory**: Main application directory (currently minimal)
- **Configuration Directory**: Houses security and tooling configurations

## Data Flow

Data flow architecture is not yet implemented. This section will be updated as the application components are developed.

## External Dependencies

### Development Tools
- **Semgrep**: Static analysis security scanning tool
- **Azure Bicep**: Infrastructure as Code (based on security rules configuration)

### Potential Integrations
Based on the security configuration, the project may integrate with:
- Azure cloud services
- Infrastructure automation tools
- Security monitoring systems

## Deployment Strategy

Deployment strategy is not yet defined. The presence of Bicep-focused security rules suggests potential Azure cloud deployment, but this requires confirmation during development.

**Security Considerations:**
- Sensitive parameters must use @secure() decorator
- Prevention of credential exposure in logs and Azure portal
- Compliance with security logging standards (OWASP A09:2021)

## Development Notes

This project is in its foundational stage with security-first approach evident from the Semgrep configuration. The architecture will need to be defined as development progresses, with careful attention to:

1. Technology stack selection
2. Database design (if applicable)
3. API structure definition
4. Frontend framework choice
5. Authentication mechanism implementation

The security rules suggest preparation for cloud-native deployment with emphasis on credential protection and secure parameter handling.
